# Higher Order Functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Review programming principles
- Learn to use some standard array methods that use callbacks

---

## Guiding Questions

- Which programming principles have you seen so far?

- Which programming principals surprise you ?

- As a class, create an array of `favoriteMovies`. Your instructor will then share this list.

Using this array, get into groups to research and then demonstrate and share a summary of the following methods using the `favoriteMovies` array or another one of your own creation:

| Group Number/Category |   Method(s)    |
| :-------------------: | :------------: |
|           1           |   `.every()`   |
|           2           |  `.filter()`   |
|           3           |   `.find()`    |
|           4           | `.findIndex()` |
|           5           |  `.forEach()`  |
|           6           |    `.map()`    |
|           7           |   `.some()`    |
|           8           |   `.sort()`    |
