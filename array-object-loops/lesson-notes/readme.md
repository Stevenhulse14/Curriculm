# Looping over Arrays of Objects

## Learning Objectives

- Access deeply nested properties one at a time
- Learn the `for of` loop
- Loop over an array of object to access deeply nested properties

<hr>

## Guiding Questions

- Can you make an array inside of an object that is inside of an array?

  - Can you model this with code?

- Can a function that is inside an object return another object?
- Can you model this with code?

- Here is an array of songs from an album

```js
const so = [
  "Don't Give Up",
  "Sledgehammer",
  "Big Time",
  "In Your Eyes",
  "Mercy Street",
  "Shaking the Tree",
];
```

- How would you loop over them with a `for` loop?

- How would you loop over them with a `for of` loop?

- What are the pros of using a `for` loop? What are cons?

- What are the advantages of using a `for of` loop? What are the disadvantages?

Using the object below:

- Log the show name
- Log each actor object
- Log each the first season's year
- Log the first season's episode objects
- Log the first season's episode names
- Only log the episodes that have a rating less than 8
- Create a new array and push all the episodes that have a rating higher than 8 into it
