# Higher Order Functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define what makes a higher-order function.
- Define what makes a callback function.
- Write functions that accept a function as an argument and use that inputted function.

---

## Guiding Questions

- What is the definition of a higher-order function?

- What is the definition of a callback function?

- Why are anonymous functions useful for higher-order functions?

- Take a look at the functions below. Are any of the functions a higher-order function? If so, which ones and why so? If not, why not?

```js
function truthy() {
  return true;
}

function falsy() {
  return !truthy();
}

falsy(); //> false
```

- Take a look at the functions below. Are any of the functions a higher-order function? If so, which ones and why so? If not, why not?

```js
function left() {
  return "Left";
}

function right() {
  return "Right";
}

function go(goLeft = true) {
  if (goLeft === true) {
    return left;
  } else {
    return right;
  }
}
```

- Take a look at the functions below. Are any of the functions a higher-order function? If so, which ones and why so? If not, why not?

```js
const directions = [];

function storeDirections(direction) {
  directions.push(direction);
}

function go(direction, operation) {
  operation(direction);
  return direction;
}

go("Left", storeDirections);
go("Right", storeDirections);
go("Up", storeDirections);
console.log(directions); //> ["Left", "Right", "Up"]
```

- Take a look at the higher-order function below. The `transform()` function expects, as its second argument, a function that accepts at least one argument.

```js
function transform(text, fn) {
  if (typeof fn !== "function") {
    return text;
  }

  return fn(text);
}
```

Use the function above to transform the text in the following ways. For each line below, you will need to write an anonymous function.

```
"left" -> "LEFT"
"RiGhT" -> "right"
"left right left" -> "left-right-left"
"up Down left" -> "UDL"
```
