# Markdown

## Introduction

Markdown is a popular markup language. It uses simple patterns and symbols that allow anyone to write plain text and format it. It is designed to serve a similar function to HTML, but with an even simpler syntax.

Unlike a program like Microsoft Word or Google Doc, which requires you to use the GUI to create styles, markdown's plan text style makes it possible to turn anything you write into a webpage.

For example, all of the pre-readings and lesson-notes you've been reading for this class have been written in markdown. If you click on this file in GitHub (individual view), you should see a button that says `raw` and it will let you see how this text is written.
