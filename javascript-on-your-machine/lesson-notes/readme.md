# JavaScript on Your Machine

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe what NodeJS is and why it's important.
- Install NodeJS on your local machine through Homebrew.
- Run JavaScript files with the `node` command.
- Access command line arguments with the `node` command.
- Run JavaScript in the NodeJS REPL.

---

## Guiding Questions

- What is NodeJS?

- Why was NodeJS so influential on the JavaScript community?

- How can you check which version of `node` you have?

- Create a new `.js` file and put the following inside.

```js
function addFruit(fruits, fruit) {
  fruits.push(fruit);
  return fruits;
}

const fruits = ["üçì", "üçê", "üçé"];
addFruit(fruits, "ü•ù");
```

How can you run this file from the command line?

- Nothing is shown on the command line when you run this file. How can you update the file to print the response to your terminal window?

- Try adding the following line inside your file. What gets logged out? What _data type_ is `process`?

```js
console.log(process);
```

- Try adding the following inside of your file. What gets logged out? What _data type_ is `process.argv`?

```js
console.log(process.argv);
```

- What will always be the first and second elements of `process.argv`?

- Update your `.js` file to contain the code below.

```js
function addFruit(fruits, fruit) {
  fruits.push(fruit);
  return fruits;
}

const fruits = ["üçì", "üçê", "üçé"];
const input = process.argv[2];
if (input) {
  let result = addFruit(fruits, input);
  console.log(result);
} else {
  console.log("No fruit added...");
}
```

How can you change what you run on the command line so that a new fruit is added to the array?

- After running the code and adding fruit, your file will not change. This means your changes are not permanent. Why is this?

- How can you open the NodeJS REPL?

- How can you run code in the NodeJS REPL?

- How can you exit the NodeJS REPL?

- Is it possible to write a full function over multiple lines in the REPL? How?
