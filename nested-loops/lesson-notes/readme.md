# Two Dimensional Arrays and Nested Loops

## Learning Objectives

- What are two dimensional arrays and what is an example of where you might encounter one?
- Be able to access individual items inside a 2D array
- Be able to loop over each item in a 2D array

## Guiding Questions

- What is a possible real-world example of a 2D array?

```js
const ticTacToeBoard = [
  [null, null, null],
  [null, null, null],
  [null, null, null],
];
```

- How can you put an `X` in the middle square?
- How can you put an `O` in the middle right square?
- How can you put an `X` in the bottom left square?

- Write a function to check if `X` has won in the middle row.
- Write a function to check of `O` has won in the last column.
- Write a function to count how many plays are left.

Discuss the best way to write a function to 'reset' the board.
