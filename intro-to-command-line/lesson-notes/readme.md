## Introductory Command Line

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Differentiate between the GUI and the CLI.
- Define and build absolute paths.
- Define and build relative paths.
- Use the `open` command from the command line.
- Use the command line to navigate via absolute and relative paths.
- List files and folders in your current directory with `ls`.
- Define and use flags on the command line.
- Create new directories with the `mkdir` command.
- Create new files with the `touch` command.
- Install and use the `code` command to open VSCode.

## Guiding Questions

- What does GUI stand for?

- What does CLI stand for?

- Why do developers need to use the CLI instead of the GUI?

- "Your computer's filesystem is structured like a tree." What does this statement mean?

- What is the difference between a directory and a file?

- Can a file live in two different directories? Why or why not?

- Open a new terminal window and then type the following command: `pwd`. Then, hit enter.

What is displayed?

- What does `pwd` stand for?

- Take a look at the following file path:

```
/Users/pursuit
```

Is this an absolute or relative path? How do you know?

- What does it mean for a path to be absolute?

- In the same terminal window, type `open .` and then answer the following questions:

What does the `open` command do?

What does the `.` represent?

- What is your "home directory?"

- In the Finder program, you should see several folders and potentially a few files in your home directory.

In your terminal window, type `ls`.

How is the output in the terminal window related to what you see in the Finder window?

- `pwd`, `open`, and `ls` are all examples of commands. What is a command?

- Commands are a bit like functions. For example, the `open` command you used earlier took an argument of `.`. How would you describe the argument that the `open` command takes?

- In addition to arguments, commands can include flags or options. In the command line context, what is a flag or option?

- How can you identify flags or options in a command?

- Try running the following command in your terminal window.

```bash
ls -a
```

How does the `-a` flag change the `ls` command?

- Try running the following command in your terminal window.

```bash
ls -l
```

How does the `-l` flag change the `ls` command?

How can you combine the `-a` and `-l` flags?

- Try running the following command in your terminal window, which uses a relative path:

```
open ./Desktop
```

How do you know the above path is a relative path?

> **Note:** If the above command does not work, it likely means you've somehow gotten out of your home directory. Close the terminal program and then re-open it. Then, try running the command above again.

- What does it mean for a path to be relative?

- Try running the following command in your terminal window, which uses a relative path:

```
open ./Documents
```

What folder opened up in Finder? Why?

> **Note:** If the above command does not work, it likely means you've somehow gotten out of your home directory. Close the terminal program and then re-open it. Then, try running the command above again.

- Is there a difference between running `open ./Desktop` and `open Desktop`?

- The `cd` command allows you to move between different directories. What does `cd` stand for? What arguments does it take?

- Try running the following two commands in your terminal window.

```
cd Desktop
ls
```

What has changed after running those two commands?

- Try running the following two commands in your terminal window.

```
cd ~
ls
```

What does the `~` represent?

- Try running the following two commands in your terminal window.

```
cd ~/Desktop
ls
```

What is the difference between running `cd ~/Desktop` and `cd Desktop`?

- Do you think `~/Desktop` is an absolute or relative path? Why?

- In the terminal, use the `open` command to open your home directory. Then, create a new folder inside with the name `test-directory`.

What command can you use in the terminal to see this new directory?

- In the Finder, delete the `test-directory`. _(Do not delete any other folders!)_

In the terminal, run the following command and then look to your Finder window.

```
mkdir another-test-directory
```

What did the `mkdir` command do? What does `mkdir` stand for?

- The `touch` command allows you to create a file. Run the following commands in the terminal.

```
touch ./another-test-directory/my-test-file.js
cd ./another-test-directory
ls
```

In your own words, describe what the above commands are doing.

- Try running the following command, which will have you navigate _up_ a directory.

```
cd ..
```

What directory are you currently in after running the above command? What does `..` represent?

- Open up VSCode. What is VSCode? Why do developers not use something like Word or TextEdit to write code?

- Follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) to access the `code` command in your terminal.

After doing so, close your terminal program and then re-open it. Then, try running the following command:

```
code ~/another-test-directory
```

What do you see in VSCode?

- Create two new files _at the same time_ in your `another-test-directory` folder from the command line: `readme.md` and `my-file.txt`.

How can you create multiple files at once?

- Each of the files in `another-test-directory` has a different file extension. What is a file extension, and what does each file extension represent on the files you've created?

Once you're done, you can drag the `another-test-directory` folder to the trash.
