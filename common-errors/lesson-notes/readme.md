# Common Errors

## Learning Objectives

- Use the stacktrace to identify where an error might be occurring.
- Describe and fix syntax errors.
- Describe and fix reference errors.
- Describe and fix type errors.

---

## Guiding Questions

- What would the following stacktrace from Repl.it indicate to you?

```
ReferenceError: i is not defined
at listCharacters (/home/runner/Warmup-Common-Errors/index.js:14:34)
at /home/runner/Warmup-Common-Errors/index.js:20:1
```

- What are some situations where you might see a `SyntaxError`?

- What are some situations where you might see a `ReferenceError`?

- What are some situations where you might see a `TypeError`?

- Run the code below. Then, answer each question or complete each task below the code block.

```js
function levelUpCharacter(characer) {
  if (character.level >= 20) {
    character.level = 20;
  } else {
    character.level++;
  }
  return character;
}

const barret = { name: "Barret", level: 2 };
levelUpCharacter(barret);
console.log(barret);
```

- What type of error occurred? Why?

- Where does the error occur? How did you find it?

- Now that you know more about the error, fix the error(s) to get the code working.

- Run the code below. Then, answer each question or complete each task below the code block.

```js
function levelUpCharacter(character, level) {
  if (levil > 20) {
    level = 20;
  } else {
    level++;
  }
  return level;
}

const newLevel = levelUpCharacter("Barret", 21);
console.log(newLevel); //> `newLevel` should be 20.
```

- Was an error thrown when the code was run?

- Did the function work as expected? Why or why not?

- What's the problem with the code above? _Why does it not throw an error?_

- How could you fix the code above, so it works as intended?

- In cases where no explicit error is thrown, how do you think you would identify a problem?
