## Guiding Questions

- Why might you want a problem solving methodology?

- What's a non-technical problem that you might want to use a problem solving methodology for?

- The first step of Polya's Problem Solving Technique is to "understand the problem." What would it look like to _not understand the problem?_

- Part of understanding the problem is identifying inputs and outputs. What are inputs and outputs? Why is it important to define them?

- What is a "clarifying question?"

- The second part of Polya's Problem Solving Technique is to "devise a plan." What would it look like to _not devise a plan_ before solving a problem?

- Why is it important to try and come up with multiple paths for your problem?

- The third step of Polya's Problem Solving Technique is to "carry out the plan." What would it look like to _not carry out the plan?_

- Despite all of your planning, what kinds of problems can arise when carrying out your plan?

- What should you do if your plan does not work?

- The fourth step of Polya's Problem Solving Technique is to "look back." Why is this a necessary step?

- What might happen if you don't "look back?"

- Take a look at the following logic problem. Use Polya's Problem Solving Technique to help you solve this problem. Even if you think you know the answer, go through each step of the process.

  > Five people were running a race. **A**iden finished before **B**rooke, but behind **C**ory. **D**esmond finished before **E**leanor, but behind **B**rooke. What was the finishing order?

- Take a look at the following logic problem. Use Polya's Problem Solving Technique to help you solve this problem. Even if you think you know the answer, go through each step of the process.

  > A girl meets a snake and a deer in the forest. The snake lies every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and the other days he speaks the truth. The deer lies on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, and the other days of the week she speaks the truth. “Yesterday I was lying,” the snake told the girl. “So was I,” said the a deer. What day is it?
