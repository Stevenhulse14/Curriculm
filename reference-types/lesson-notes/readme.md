# Reference Types

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Differentiate between primitive and reference types.
- Mentally evaluate code blocks that use primitive and reference types.
- Differentiate between destructive and non-destructive methods.

---

## Guiding Questions

- What are the five most common primitive types?

- What other two data types are primitive types but are less commonly used?

- Anything that is not a primitive type is a reference type. What data types have you already worked with in this class that is a reference type?

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  let myHobby = "reading";
  let yourHobby = myHobby;
  myHobby = "playing video games";

  console.log(myHobby, yourHobby);
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  let myHobbies = ["reading"];
  let yourHobbies = myHobbies;
  myHobbies[0] = "playing video games";

  console.log(myHobbies, yourHobbies);
  ```

- What does it mean for a data type to be a reference type?

- Will the code below throw an error? Why or why not?

  ```js
  const hobbies = ["reading", "playing video games"];
  hobbies[hobbies.length] = "biking";
  ```

- Why does the code below log `false`?

  ```js
  console.log({ hobbies: ["reading"] } === {});
  ```

- Why does the code below log `false`?

  ```js
  console.log({ hobbies: ["reading"] } === { hobbies: ["reading"] });
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  const myHobbies = ["reading", "playing video games"];
  const yourHobbies = myHobbies;
  myHobbies.push("biking");

  console.log(myHobbies, yourHobbies);
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  const videoGames = {
    description: "playing video games",
  };
  const reading = videoGames;
  reading.description = "reading";

  console.log(videoGames, reading);
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  const louie = {
    name: "Louie James",
    hobbies: ["reading", "playing video games", "biking"],
  };
  const jody = {
    name: "Jody Hawkins",
    hobbies: louie.hobbies,
  };

  console.log(louie === jody);
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  const louie = {
    name: "Louie James",
    hobbies: ["reading", "playing video games", "biking"],
  };
  const jody = {
    name: "Jody Hawkins",
    hobbies: louie.hobbies,
  };

  console.log(louie.hobbies === jody.hobbies);
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  const louie = {
    name: "Louie James",
    hobbies: ["reading", "playing video games", "biking"],
  };
  const jody = {
    name: "Jody Hawkins",
    hobbies: louie.hobbies,
  };

  louie.hobbies.pop();
  console.log(louie.hobbies, jody.hobbies);
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  const louie = {
    name: "Louie James",
    hobbies: ["reading", "playing video games", "biking"],
  };
  const jody = {
    name: "Jody Hawkins",
    hobbies: louie.hobbies.slice(0, 2),
  };

  console.log(louie.hobbies === jody.hobbies);
  ```

- Mentally evaluate the following code. What do you expect will be logged? Why?

  ```js
  const louie = {
    name: "Louie James",
    hobbies: ["reading", "playing video games", "biking"],
  };
  const jody = {
    name: "Jody Hawkins",
    hobbies: louie.hobbies.slice(0, 2).concat("coding", "painting"),
  };

  console.log(jody.hobbies);
  ```
